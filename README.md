# Datalytix
#### A proof of work to showcase the dashboard component I developed at Ciphers.

------------

Codebase for **Datalytix.**
### Sneak Peek
Datalytix is the frontend component of the full-stack dashboard I developed at Ciphers, serving as a proof of work to showcase my contributions and expertise in building scalable, 
data-driven applications.

------------

### Features
- Implemented a partial error handling strategy to maintain data flow despite issues. ( It shows error state only on components for which data fetching failed and renders rest of data properly )
- Integrated date-based comparison features for enhanced analytical insights.
- Established a cap on historical data exposure to control data visibility.
- Incorporated role-based and distribution chain filters to tailor the user experience.
- Represented various types of data using suitable components.
- As this is a frontend focused component of the dashboard the data comes from a static source.

### Tech and Libraries
- Nextjs
- React
- Typescript
- Vercel
- Shadcn
- React Table
- Luxon
- Qs

------------

### Optimizations and Best Practices
- Used useMemo hook to memoize complex computations.
- Created highly reusable and adaptable components in order to deduplicate code.
- Ensured fully responsive web design.

------------ 

- Locally setting up
  1. Clone this repo  
   ```git clone https://github.com/IamAyaanSk/datalytix.git```

  2. Install dependencies  
   ```pnpm install```

  3. Run the development server   
   ```pnpm dev```
 
  4. Building   
  ```pnpm build```

  5. Starting the server   
  ```pnpm start```

## Note

- All data and fields are random made up to ensure privacy.     
- When visiting the app you may encounter demo of partial errors state ( It is intentional to showcase the error state )
